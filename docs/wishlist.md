# Project Wishlist

Unranked idea pool for future work. Capture quickly; do not treat this file as execution-ready scope.

## How To Use This File

- This is a capture inbox, not an implementation queue.
- Adding an item here does not authorize engineering work.
- Items must be promoted into roadmap/plans before implementation.

## Promotion Rules

| Item Scope | Promotion Path |
| --- | --- |
| `Companion` | Move into `docs/roadmap-current.md`, then create/update a plan in `docs/plans/` before implementation. |
| `Head Unit` | Create or update `Blocked by Head Unit` in `docs/project-vision.md`; do not proceed past companion-side boundary until dependency status advances. |
| `Cross-App` | Create or update `Blocked by Head Unit` in `docs/project-vision.md`; split execution so companion work continues only where independent. |
